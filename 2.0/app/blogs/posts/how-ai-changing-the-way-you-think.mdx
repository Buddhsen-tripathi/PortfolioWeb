A few years ago, AI felt distant. Like a thing only researchers or big tech companies played with. Now, it's just... here. In our phones. In our browsers. Writing code, fixing sentences, building slides. It quietly slipped into our daily flow.
It's not just changing what we do. It's changing how we think.

Kind of like how English became the go-to language around the world, or how websites exploded during the dot-com boom. Back then, we slowly accepted something new as the standard. This feels like one of those moments.

AI is becoming the new default. And we're all adjusting in real time.

When I first started coding, I used to spend hours reading long documentation and searching for errors on Stack Overflow. It worked, but it was slow and sometimes boring.

Now, I use AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot almost every day and I'm sure there are many just like me. Copilot suggests code, fixes small errors, and helps me build faster. It is like having a friend who knows a lot about coding and is always ready to help. Even reviewing code is easier now. Just commit, and Copilot reviews the changes. It explains poorly written code and helps find potential bugs.

This doesn't mean I'm a better coder overnight. But it makes the work feel smoother and less tiring.

This shift reminds me of when English became the language people learned to work together. It made communication easier. AI is making coding easier in a similar way.

Before AI, building a new website or app was hard. I had to find design ideas, sketch layouts, picking suitable fonts and write everything from scratch. It was like the early days of the internet, when making websites was something only experts could do.

Now, I combine ready-made UI templates with AI tools like <a href="https://v0.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v0.dev</a> or <a href="https://bolt.new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolt</a>. I explain what I'm picturing, and they create a basic design to start with. 
What I love most is that I don't feel stuck anymore. Even on slow days, I know I can open one of these tools and start with something. The pressure to "be creative" right from the start is gone. I focus more on refining and shaping the final experience, rather than stressing about where to begin.

If it wasn't for AI, I might've turned into a WordPress or Wix developer.

When I want to know something today, I don't always google it. I ask AI tools like ChatGPT, Grok, or Perplexity. They give me answers, summaries, and opinions, not just links.

The phrase "Google it" used to be the default. Now it's slowly being replaced with "Ask ChatGPT" or "Let me run this through Perplexity." That shift might feel small, but it's a big change in how we think. Instead of digging through multiple tabs or long articles, we go straight to something that sounds like a conversation.
It feels faster, and often it is. You don't need to scroll through ads, skip cookie banners, or figure out which link actually has what you need. You ask, and something replies with exactly what you were looking for or at least close to it.

But that also means we're trusting machines more than we used to. We're relying on the way they interpret facts and language. That's not always a bad thing, but it can go wrong. If the AI makes a mistake or gives outdated information, we might miss it. It's easy to take the response at face value because it sounds confident and well-written. But it's still on us to pause, verify, and think for ourselves.

AI is great, but it also brings problems that are easy to overlook. I've come across places online where people use AI to create fake images and deepfakes. Some websites or entire social media accounts are being run almost entirely by AI, with little to no human control. That makes it hard to know what is real, and it spreads false information quickly.

But this is no longer just about memes or viral posts. I've seen AI-generated videos that use real people's faces, often private individuals, placed into fake interviews, product reviews, or even explicit content. Most of them have no idea their face is being used.
It's honestly scary to realize how easily a photo from Instagram or LinkedIn can be pulled into a model, combined with cloned voices, and turned into something that looks real. Once it's online, it spreads fast, and there is almost no way to take it back.

There are Discord servers and Reddit threads where people actively share tips on how to make fake content look more believable, how to remove AI watermarks, and how to trick platforms into thinking it's real. This isn't happening in hidden corners anymore. It's out in the open, and it's growing fast.

It reminds me of the early days of email, when spam and scams were everywhere, and people had no idea what to trust. But now the content is harder to spot, and the risks are bigger. Identity theft, fake news, and manipulated media can spread faster than most of us can react.
This is why we need more honest conversations about what we create with AI. Just because something is possible doesn't mean it's okay. We need to slow down sometimes and ask if what we are building is good for others too.

AI helps me with so many small things that used to take forever. I use it to come up with blog titles, fix grammar, polish presentations, or even just write that one awkward sentence I keep rewriting. What started as simple support has slowly turned into full creative assistance.

Sometimes, it feels like having a thoughtful assistant in the room. I type an idea, and it gives me a few ways to say it. I describe a rough layout, and it shows me how to build it. I ask it to explain something, and it teaches me like a friend would.

But there's another side to it too.

I've seen people let AI take over the whole process. From writing articles to designing logos to building entire apps, everything gets generated. It works. It gets things done. But it also makes me wonder that are we losing the messy, personal, slightly broken parts of creativity that made things feel human?

When everything is polished and perfect, it's hard to know what someone really felt while making it. The voice feels quieter. The edges are softer. The imperfections that made things memorable start to fade away.

For me, AI is still a tool. A very smart one, yes, but a tool. I try to use it like a sketchbook, somewhere to start, not somewhere to finish. The best parts still come from sitting with the idea, shaping it with intention, and putting a little bit of yourself into the final version.
And maybe that's where the balance lives. AI doesn't kill creativity, but it changes where it begins. It gives us space to explore. But the heart of the work still has to come from us.
Because in the end, people connect with people. Not just pixels.

AI is not just a tool anymore. It feels like a real co-pilot in many parts of life.

It has changed how I code, design, learn, and create. It helps me work faster and think in new ways. But it also brings new challenges like misuse, over-reliance, and confusion about what is real. It makes me wonder what new vulnerabilities or exploit risks will become normal. Basic cybersecurity is going to level up fast. That's exciting but also kind of scary.

This is not the first time things are shifting. People adapt over time. We've adapted to new cultures and new tech before. But this time, things are moving faster than ever.
