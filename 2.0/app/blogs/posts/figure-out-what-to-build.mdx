When I was doing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I chose a specialization in networks and security. Cybersecurity always stood out to me. I liked the mindset, the tooling, and how different it felt from regular development work. But like most fresh graduates, I had to be practical. Getting a job in cybersecurity isn't easy without experience, so I focused on software development instead. It was more straightforward and had better job opportunities at the time.

Even though I moved into development, my interest in cybersecurity didn't disappear. I kept learning on the side. I read blogs, watched tutorials, and tried out tools related to OSINT(Open Source Intelligence). That's when I started noticing a pattern.

When you're learning OSINT, one of the first things you realize is that there's no single place to get all the tools you need. You end up visiting different websites like one for checking usernames, another for doing a reverse image search, another for analyzing metadata, and so on.

Many of these tools look outdated. Some are full of ads. Others stop working randomly or give inconsistent results. It gets frustrating, especially for someone new to this space.

At one point, I thought, "I already know how to build full-stack applications. Instead of jumping between 10 different websites, why not build one platform that brings all the useful OSINT tools together?"
That idea became the starting point for DeepFind.Me.

<a class="text-blue-400" href="https://DeepFind.Me" target="_blank">DeepFind.Me</a> is a single platform where you can find a growing set of OSINT tools. It doesn't store any of your search history or personal data. The goal is to make these tools easy to use and accessible, especially for people who are just getting started with OSINT.

Right now, it includes:
- A username lookup tool to check where a username appears across the internet
- Tools to check if an email or password has been part of a known data breach
- Basic encryption and encoding utilities
- AI-powered features like image analysis and location estimation etc.<br/>

I didn't build DeepFind.Me to turn it into a big business. I just built something I wish I had when I started learning OSINT.

People often say, "I want to build something, but I don't know what." I've been there. Here's how I approached it, and how you can too.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="start-by-solving-your-own-problems">1. Start by Solving Your Own Problems </h3>
DeepFind.Me came from my own experience. I was constantly opening different tabs, switching between websites, and wasting time. It wasn't efficient. That pain point gave me a clear idea â€” build a platform that makes OSINT easier.

If something in your day-to-day life feels annoying or repetitive, that's a good place to start. Try to build something that fixes it. Even if only you use it at first, that's okay.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="mix-what-you-know-with-what-youre-interested-in">2. Mix What You Know with What You're Interested In</h3>
I knew how to build apps, and I was interested in cybersecurity. That overlap gave me the motivation to start. You don't have to be an expert. You just need to know enough to take the first step.

Think about your own skills and interests. Maybe you enjoy fitness and also know how to code. That could lead to a cool workout tracker. Or maybe you're into music and data. You could build tools for indie artists. When you build something you actually care about, it becomes much easier to stick with it.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="dont-worry-about-trends">3. Don't Worry About Trends</h3>
It's tempting to chase whatever is trending online like the newest AI tool, crypto thing, or startup idea. But trends fade quickly. If you're not genuinely interested in the space, you'll probably lose motivation halfway through.

Instead, build something you would actually use. That's what I did with DeepFind.Me. Even if no one else touched it, I knew I'd find it useful. That mindset helps you focus and finish what you start.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="launch-fast-improve-later">4. Launch Fast, Improve Later </h3>
The first version of DeepFind.Me wasn't perfect. Some tools were slow, and the design was basic. But I still put it out there. I figured I could keep improving it as I went along.

You don't need to wait until everything is perfect. Just build a simple version that works and share it. Getting real feedback is more valuable than holding onto an idea for months.

You don't need a million-dollar idea to build something valuable. You just need a real problem and a bit of curiosity.

If you're stuck thinking about what to build, here's a quick checklist:

- What do you find annoying or repetitive in your day?
- What would you use if it existed?
- What are you curious about?
- What skills do you already have?

Answering those questions honestly can give you direction.

And if you're curious about OSINT or just want to see what I built, you can check out <a class="text-blue-400" href="https://DeepFind.Me" target="_blank">DeepFind.Me</a>. It's still growing, but it already helps people explore digital footprints more easily than before.

Start with what you know. Build what you'd use. Keep it simple. You'll figure the rest out along the way.
