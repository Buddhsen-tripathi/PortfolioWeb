A **critical zero-day vulnerability** in Microsoft SharePoint Server is currently under active exploitation by attackers worldwide, with security experts describing it as one of the most severe SharePoint vulnerabilities in recent years. The attacks began around July 18, 2025, and have already compromised dozens of servers globally.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="cve-2025-53770">The Critical Vulnerability: CVE-2025-53770</h2>
<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53770" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">CVE-2025-53770</a> is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability rated **9.8/10** on the CVSS scale, affecting on-premises SharePoint installations. The flaw is caused due by SharePoint's unsafe deserialization of untrusted data, allowing unauthorized attackers to execute code over a network without any user interaction required.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="affected-systems">Affected Systems</h3>
The vulnerability impacts:
- Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019
- Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016
- Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Importantly, SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365 is not affected by these attacks.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="active-exploitation">Active Exploitation and Attack Methods</h2>
Security researchers have identified a sophisticated attack campaign exploiting this zero-day vulnerability. Unlike typical web shell attacks, attackers are deploying a stealthy payload called **spinstall0.aspx** designed specifically to extract cryptographic secrets from SharePoint servers.

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="attack-timeline">Attack Timeline and Scale</h3>
- July 18, 2025: Initial wave of attacks detected around 18:00 CET
- July 19, 2025: Second wave around 07:30 CET
- Dozens of servers have been confirmed compromised using identical payloads

The attacks target internet-facing SharePoint servers to:
- Install backdoors for persistent access
- Extract SharePoint server MachineKey configurations including ValidationKey and DecryptionKey
- Enable full system takeover capabilities

<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-53770" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">CVE-2025-53770</a> is a variant of <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-49706" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500">CVE-2025-49706</a>, which Microsoft attempted to patch in their July 2025 security update. However, the patches were incomplete, leading to this more dangerous zero-day exploitation. The vulnerability is also connected to:

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="Mitigation-measures">Mitigation Measures</h2>
Microsoft recommends immediate implementation of the following protections:

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="essential-steps">Essential Steps</h3>

- Enable AMSI Integration: Configure Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) in SharePoint with Full Mode for optimal protection
- Deploy Defender Antivirus on all SharePoint servers
- Disconnect from Internet: If AMSI cannot be enabled, remove internet access from SharePoint servers
- Rotate ASP.NET Machine Keys: Critical step after applying security updates
- Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or equivalent threat detection solutions

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="detection-and-monitoring">Detection and Monitoring</h3>
Organizations should monitor for specific indicators of compromise:
- Suspicious IIS worker process behavior
- POST requests to /_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx?DisplayMode=Edit
- Scanning from IP addresses: 107.191.58.76, 104.238.159.149, and 96.9.125.147

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary my-4" id="govt-sec-response">Government and Security Agency Response</h2>
Multiple government agencies have issued urgent warnings:

- CISA added CVE-2025-53770 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and mandated federal agencies apply mitigations by July 21, 2025
- Canadian Centre for Cyber Security confirmed exploitation occurring in Canada
- FBI acknowledged awareness of the attacks and stated they are working with federal and private sector partners
- Australian Cyber Security Centre issued advisories for affected organizations

The severity of this attack campaign underscores the critical importance of maintaining updated security configurations and having robust incident response plans for zero-day exploitations targeting enterprise infrastructure.
